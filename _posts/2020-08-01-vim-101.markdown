Let's split this stuff into 3 catagories: Commands, Motions and Text Objects
## Commands
* d - delete(also cut)
* c - change(delete, then place in insert mode)
* y - yank(copy)
* v - visually select

## Motions
* a - all
* i - in
* t - 'til
* f - find forward
* F - find backward

## Text Objects
* w - word
* s - sentence 
* p - paragraph
* t - tags

Then the common pattern is: `Commands` + `Motions` + `Text Objects` 

For example:
* daw - delete all word
* ciw - change in word
